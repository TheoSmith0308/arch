# bootctl --path=/boot install
Let the Bootctl command run its course. It should automatically set up default configuration files.

Next, you must find the UUID for /dev/sda2, the partition that Arch Linux is installed.
# blkid /dev/sda2

something like "3f53b620-5676-4370-90a5-fbed6af2fcfb""

After getting the UUID for your Root partition, use the touch command to make a new Arch Linux menu entry.
# touch /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

Open the new file in nano.
# nano -w /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

Paste the following code into the “arch.conf” file.

title   Arch Linux
linux   /vmlinuz-linux
initrd  /initramfs-linux.img
initrd  /intel-ucode

Exit and save.

Now run the following command
# echo"options root=PARTUUID=$(blkid -s PARTUUID -o value dev/sda?) rootflags=subvol=@ rw" >> /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

Replace "sda? with your current ROOT directory"

Open the  “loader.conf” file in the Nano text editor using the command below.
# nano /boot/loader/loader.conf

Paste the following code into the Nano text editor.

default arch
timeout 3
console-mode max
editor no

Save and close.

Update Systemd-boot with bootctl.
# bootctl --path=/boot update

Done.
